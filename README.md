## Built With

* [Bottle (Python)](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) - The web framework used
* [React (JS)](https://reactjs.org/) - FrontEnd Framework
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Frontend module bundler

## Authors

* **Gilad Navot** - *Initial work* - [navotgil](https://github.com/navotgil)

## Getting Started

First, visit [The Demo](https://py-mon.herokuapp.com/) (hopefully it will be awake)
Clone the project and make sure you have all of the tools below installed.

### Prerequisites

* [A computer](https://www.ebay.com/itm/386-Computer-AMD-80386DX40-40Mhz-8Mb-RAM-Windows-3-11-Old-DOS-Game-PC/153285622134)
* [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/)
* [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (needed for deployment)
* [Remote MySql Server](https://www.db4free.net) (needed for deployment)


### Installing

1. Create a new "pymon" folder under your dev folder.
2. cd into the folder.
3. clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/navotgil/pymon
    ```
4. run pip and install the required libraries
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. cd into "/frontend" folder, run npm and install the required libraries
    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
5. run webpack to build the react files into the dist folder. webpack is configured to watch fie changes, so this cmd window should remain open.
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
6. create a local MYSQL DB on your machine for now follow the instruction on this [section](#installing-the-db)
Update your credentials in the dbutils.py file!!!!


### Installing the DB

Update your credentials in the dbutils.py file!!!!
```
connection = pymysql.connect(host='db4free.net',
                             user='<your user>',
                             password='<your password>',
                             db='<your db>',
                             charset='utf8',
                             autocommit=True,
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)
```
And run the following commands on your MySql workbench
```
CREATE TABLE `game` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `status` varchar(30) DEFAULT 'open',
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `sequence` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci NOT NULL,
  `creator` varchar(30) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'anonymous',
  `step` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;


CREATE TABLE `player` (
  `id` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `avatar` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'anonymous',
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;


CREATE TABLE `playergame` (
  `game` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `player` varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  `status` varchar(30) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci NOT NULL DEFAULT 'new',
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

ALTER TABLE `game`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`);

ALTER TABLE `player`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`);

ALTER TABLE `playergame`
  ADD KEY `game` (`game`),
  ADD KEY `player` (`player`);

ALTER TABLE `game`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=51;

ALTER TABLE `playergame`
  ADD CONSTRAINT `game` FOREIGN KEY (`game`) REFERENCES `game` (`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT,
  ADD CONSTRAINT `player` FOREIGN KEY (`player`) REFERENCES `player` (`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT;
COMMIT;
```

## Deployment

The project is "Heroku Deploy Ready"

In order for the project to work online you will have to use a remote MySql DB
one option is to use the following [service](https://www.db4free.net)

1. Set a DB onine (following this [step](#installing-the-db) again, this time online) 

2. Don't forget to update the dbutils.py credentials

3. Create a new Heroku app

4. Git push heroku master
